# Version 1.1

Some nodes wouldn't return error immediately if error was returned by a child
node. This has been fixed.

# Version 1.0

Initial release

Can manually create a BehaviorTree by creating BehaviorNodes and putting them
together, or can use BT::BehaviorLuaFactory to generate a tree from a lua
script.
